# The trojan access detection rules detects access to known Trojans already 
# installed on a server. Uploading of Trojans is part of the Anti-Virus rules 
# and uses external Anti Virus program when uploading files.
#
# Detection of Trojans access is especially important in a hosting environment
# where the actual Trojan upload may be done through valid methods and not
# through hacking.
# --
# 
# NOTE Trojans detection is based on checking elements controlled by the client. 
#      A determined attacked can bypass those checks. We are working on 
#      enchaining the checks so it would require a major change in the Trojan
#      to overcome.
#      
# NOTE We found out that Trojan horses are not detected easily by Anti-Virus 
#      software when uploading as the signature set of AV software is not tuned
#      for this purpose. We are working on adding signature tuned to detect
#      Trojans upload to file uploading inspection.
